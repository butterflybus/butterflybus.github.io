##Butterfly Bus â€“ About Houses, Most-Mobile

This is a blog about houses, most-mobile.  Also known as Motor Homes, or sometimes called recreation vehicles (RVs).
In the last few years, I have learned a bit about this amazing creations, and although some of it is in
my book <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">The Slums of Palo Alto</a>, I wanted to have a site
where I could put more information and not be constrained by the purpose of the book.  Hence this site.

The name "Butterfly Bus" combines two things:

   * My wife loves butterflies, and can very easily be distracted by them.  Even when I am revealing my deepest secrets to her, she might see one and delightedly say "Butterfly!"  At first this was not so delightful for me, but after thirty years together, it has now become very endearing :-)
   * When I decided to seriously investigate RVs / MHs, I had a constraint that we needed more than one bathroom otherwise "things would get unpleasant".  This constraint pushed us into fairly large Motor Homes.  On the order of 40-feet long.  My family was not with me when I first investigate these large Class-As, so they really didn't have a good feel for the size.  But there are lots of busses on the roads around us (we live near Google and Yahoo), so it was very easy to convey the size by simply (and delightfully) saying "Bus!"

So now Butterfly Bus combines the two things that can cause most of my atomic family members to delightedly call them out "Butterfly!", "Bus!", and some day
we will own the perfect version: "Butterfly Bus!!!".
